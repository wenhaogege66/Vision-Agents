"""
xAI Realtime Voice Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to build a real-time voice conversation AI
using xAI's Grok Voice Agent API with Vision Agents.

The agent uses xAI's realtime WebSocket API for:
- Low-latency voice conversations
- Server-side voice activity detection (VAD)
- Natural voice responses using xAI's voice options

Requirements:
- XAI_API_KEY environment variable
- STREAM_API_KEY and STREAM_API_SECRET environment variables
