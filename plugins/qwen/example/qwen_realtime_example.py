# This is a basic example using Qwen Realtime with Vision Agents
# To run this example, you must have DASHSCOPE_API_KEY set in your env.
# Do note that the model is hosted in Singapore so depending on your location, the latency may vary.
# This model also does not support text input so once you join the call, simply start speaking to the agent.
